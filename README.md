# Lentacular
A photo manipulation app made with Node.JS and NW.JS

# Motivation
This app is just an example taken from a tutorial to try to learn more about node.js and nw.js, it is a self contained **Desktop WebApp** that allows you to
browse pictures in your computer, apply filters and save the changes to a file in your computer.

#The App
Basically the app is a self contained WebView that allows interaction between the code and the OS to make use of its resources and APIs.
It uses NodeJS libraries to read from the filesystem and write to the filesystem, as well as [CamanJS](http://camanjs.com/) for the photo filters.

#Builds
You can download the binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/JohnQUnknown/Lentacular/releases) section, there are binaries for Linux, Windows and OSX on 32 and 64 bits, these were compiled using NWJS.
